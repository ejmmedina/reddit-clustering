# Cluster Analysis of Reddit Posts
##### Data Mining and Wrangling mini-project by Elijah Justin Medina

From a given sample Reddit posts, we explore and analyze the titles, authors, and content of the posts and uncover the different subreddits that the posts were extracted from. We performed cluster analysis on the different posts to identify these subreddits unsupervised.
